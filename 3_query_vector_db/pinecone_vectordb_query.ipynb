    "# 3. Working With Pinecone Vector Database\n",
    "Although Vector Databases have existed long before Large Language Models, vector DBs have become an important part of many LLM solutions. In particular, Retreival Augmented Generation (or RAG) architecture addresses LLM's halucinations and issues with longer-term memory by augmenting the user's prompt with the results of a search accross a vector DB. [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) is a cloud-based vector database that is easy to integrate with your CML workflow, as this notebook shows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in the previous exervice you created CML jobs to scrape a site and load each page into Pinecone vector DB. This notebook will focus on interacting with Pinecone from a Jupyter notebook.\n",
